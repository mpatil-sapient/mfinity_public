INSPIRATION
After using object oriented programming languages for decades, im trying my hands at functional programming. Having focussed a lot on Microsoft stack lately, i chose F#. 
This is my first proof-of-concept to help compare the performance of the two. I'm planning to implement a few algorithms in C# & F# and compare them side-by-side.
Any help & comments are appreciated.
