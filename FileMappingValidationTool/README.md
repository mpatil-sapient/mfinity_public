<b>INSPIRATION</b><br /> 
There are loads of file comparors out there, but when it comes to binary file comparison it isn't straight forward. I felt the need to design something that will compare two files and run a few validation checks to log key differences in the data.
The design is flexible to allow for adding validations and also supporting additional file types in the future.<br />
